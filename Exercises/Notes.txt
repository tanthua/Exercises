Current project: chapter 9 project 3
Write a recursive function that has two inputs, first and seconds, which are both strings (From <string>).
The function should print all arrangements of the letters in first , followed by second. For example,
if first is "CAT", second is "MAN", then function should print the following:
-CATMAN
-CTAMAN
-ACTMAN
-ATCMAN
-TACMAN
-TCAMAN
The stopping case of the function occurs when the length of first has zero characters.
Helper functions:
void string::insert(size_type position, size_type number_of_copies, char c)
//Postcondition: The specified number of copies of c have been inserted into the string at the indicated position.
//Chars that used to be at or after the given position have been shifted right one spot.
void string::erase(size_type position, size_type n)
//Postcondition: n characters have been removed from the string, beginning at the specified position
